# This configuration will allow Sshwifty to run on Heroku via Dockerfile. You'll
# have to switch your Heroku "app" to Docker mode in order to deploy it. And
# after you've deployed the app, you must go to the "app" control panel and
# manually add an enviroment variable named `SSHWIFTY_LISTENPORT`, then set it's
# value to `SSHWIFTY_ENV_RENAMED:PORT` so Sshwifty can listen to the correct
# port.
#
# To enable Docker mode, see:
# https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/build-docker-images-heroku-yml
#
# To add the enviroment variable (or "Config Vars"), go to:
# https://dashboard.heroku.com/apps/<"your_app_name">/settings
#
# You only need to to it once per Heroku app.
